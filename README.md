Hi! Welcome to the repository for my portfolio.

# Summary
This is the first project I've done entirely from scratch - I made my own design in Figma (although I ended up not replicating it 100%), and wrote all the code.

I did a lot of little things I hadn't done in other projects before, like the underline on the navigation links, putting gradients over background images. It was a lot of fun learning how to create those things with CSS!

This only uses JavaScript to toggle the menu on smaller devices and automatically update the year for the Copyright in the footer.

I used the following languages to create it:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Sass/SCSS
- JavaScript

# Looking Back 
- I followed BEM - It made it so much easier going back to this project after not getting the chance to work on it for a few weeks.
- I tried to keep the site as accessible as I could - I learned quite a bit about design decisions and accessibility, such as "growing" images on hover being a trigger for migraines, so I ended up only going for a color change on hover!

# The End
Thanks for checking out my Portfolio!
